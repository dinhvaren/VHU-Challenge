                                What is Capture The Flag?
                            </h5>
                                The Capture The Flag (CTF) competition is a unique type of cybersecurity contest where participants are challenged to solve security problems or attack/defend systems.  
                                The game consists of a variety of challenges that require players to analyze, reverse engineer, exploit, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to capture the flag.  
                                All challenges are intentionally designed to be hacked legally, offering participants a safe and ethical way to gain real-world experience.

                            </h5>
                                VHU Challenge is a cybersecurity sub-event organized by Van Hien University (VHU), attracting students from all around who share a passion for hacking and information security.  
                                Its goal is to raise awareness about cybersecurity among students and young professionals.  
                                Everyone should understand common system vulnerabilities and how to protect themselves against cyberattacks in the digital age.  
                                We believe that gamification — learning through play — is the most effective way to build cybersecurity skills.
